📚 Book Comparison Project


🎯 Overview
This project involves creating a car rental website using HTML as the foundational language, combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
 The primary goal is to design a visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional platform that allows users to browse available cars, compare features, and make reservations seamlessly.
 
✨ Key Features
The car rental website includes a wide range of key features designed to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience. 
The Home Page features an engaging hero section with a call-to-action button, an overview of services, and a quick search bar for instant navigation.
 The Car Listings page displays a dynamic collection of vehicles, complete with images, specifications, and prices.
 Users can filter results by car type, price range, and availability, or use the search bar to locate specific models. 
A robust Booking System enables users to select their preferred car, input pick-up/drop-off dates, and confirm availability through an easy-to-use form,
 followed by a booking confirmation page.
